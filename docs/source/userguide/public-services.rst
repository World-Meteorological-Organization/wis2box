Public services setup
=====================

To share your data with the WIS2 network, you need to expose some of your wis2box-services to the Global Services:

* The Global Cache needs to be able to access to your HTTP-endpoint, to download data published by your wis2box-instance
* The Global Broker needs to be able to subscribe to your MQTT-endpoint, to receive WIS2 notifications published by your wis2box-instance

Nginx (HTTP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

wis2box runs a local 'nginx'-container allowing access to the following HTTP-based services on port 8999:

* wis2box-api: WIS2BOX_URL/oapi
* wis2box-ui: WIS2BOX_URL/
* incoming data: WIS2BOX_URL/wis2box-incoming
* public data: WIS2BOX_URL/data

You can edit docker/nginx/nginx.conf to control which services are exposed through the nginx-container include in your stack.

You can edit docker/docker-compose.override.yml to change the port on which the 'web-proxy'-services exposes HTTP on the local host.

.. note::
    The WIS2-notifications published by the wis2box include the path <wis2box-url>/data/ . 
    This path has to be accessible by the client receiving the WIS2Notification over MQTT, or the data referenced can not be downloaded.

To share your data with the WIS2-network make sure that 'WIS2BOX_URL' defined in dev.env points to the externally accessible url for your HTTP-services. 
After updating this environment-variable please stop & start your wis2box using wis2box-ctl.py and republish your data using the command 'wis2box metadata discovery publish'. 

.. note::
  By default the environment-variable WIS2BOX_URL=http://localhost:8999. 
  This URL will define the /data url used in the canonical link your data in MQTT and the dataset location in your discovery metadata.

wis2box-API
-----------

The wis2box-API uses `pygeoapi`_,  which implements the OGC API standards, to provide programmatic access to the data collections hosted in the backed.

.. note::
  
  Currently the default API-backend in the wis2box-stack uses `Elasticsearch`_ .
  A dedicated docker-volume 'es-data' is created on your host when you start your wis2box. 
  As long as this volume is not deleted you can remove/update the containers in the wis2box-stack without losing data.

wis2box-UI
----------

The wis2box-UI uses the wis2box-API to visualize the data configured and shared through your wis2box.

The 'map' or 'explore'-option of each dataset allows you to visualize Weather Observations per station.

Mosquitto (MQTT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, wis2box uses its own internal `Mosquitto`_-container to publish WIS2-notifications. 

To allow the Global Broker to subscribe to WIS2-notifications from your wis2box you have 2 options:

    * enable access to internal broker running in the MQTT-container on your wis2box-host
    * or configure your wis2box to use an external broker

Internal broker
---------------

The internal MQTT broker uses the username=wis2box and password=wis2box. Before opening the MQTT-port for external access we recommend setting a unique password as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    WIS2BOX_BROKER_USERNAME=wis2box-utopia
    WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD=myuniquepassword
    WIS2BOX_BROKER_PUBLIC=mqtt://${WIS2BOX_BROKER_USERNAME}:${WIS2BOX_BROKER_PASSWORD}@mosquitto:1883

The internal MQTT broker is accessible on the host=mosquitto with the docker-network used by wis2box. 
By default port 1883 of the mosquitto-container is mapped to port=1883 of the host running wis2box. 
By exposing port 1883 on your host to the Global Broker, the Global Broker can subscribe directly to the internal MQTT-broker on the wis2box.

External broker
---------------

If you do not wish to expose the internal MQTT broker on your wis2box, you can configure your wis2box to publish WIS2-notifications to an external broker by setting the ENV variable 'WIS2BOX_BROKER_PUBLIC'.

.. code-block:: bash

    # For example to use an external broker at host=external.broker.net
    WIS2BOX_BROKER_PUBLIC=mqtts://username:password@external.broker.net:8883  

Sharing data with the global broker
-----------------------------------

The official procedure for a wis2node to start sharing data with the WIS2network is still under development.

During the WIS2 pilot-phase you can contact RÃ©my from MeteoFrance, who can setup the subscription to your wis2box by the French Global Broker.
