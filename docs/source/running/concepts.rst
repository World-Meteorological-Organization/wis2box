Concepts
========

Let's clarify a few concepts as part working with wis2box:


- **topic hierarchy**: structure defined by WMO to categorize and classify
  data, allowing for easy and efficient search and identification
- **discovery metadata**: description of a dataset to be included in the WIS 2.0 Global Discovery Catalogue
- **catalogue**: a collection of discovery metadata records
- **station metadata**: description of the properties of an observing station, which provides observations and measurements
- **data mappings**: the wis2box mechanism to define and associate a topic hierarchy to a processing pipeline
